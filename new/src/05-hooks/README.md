Hooks system

- useState - a function that lets you use state in a functional component
- useEffect - a function that lets you use something like lifecycle methods in a functional component
- useRef - a function that lets you create a ref in a functional component

hooks are a way to write reusable code, instead of more classic techniques like inheritance
